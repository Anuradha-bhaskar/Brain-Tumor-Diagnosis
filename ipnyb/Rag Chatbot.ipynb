      "Answer: Gliomas present a wide range of symptoms, the specifics of which depend on several factors: the type of glioma, its size, its location within the brain, and its growth rate.

      "* **Nausea and Vomiting:** These gastrointestinal symptoms can be associated with increased intracranial pressure.\n",

However, if you experience any concerning signs or symptoms, it is vital to seek prompt medical attention from your healthcare provider for proper evaluation and diagnosis.  A thorough examination and potentially further diagnostic tests will be necessary to determine the underlying cause.\n"

      "Answer: Chemotherapy, in the context of brain tumor treatment, is the use of drugs to kill cancer cells.  It's frequently used in conjunction with radiation therapy, meaning the two treatments are often administered simultaneously or in close succession.  The specific chemotherapy regimen (the types and doses of drugs used) will vary greatly depending on the type and grade of brain tumor, the patient's overall health, and other factors.  It's crucial to understand that chemotherapy is not a standalone treatment for brain tumors in most cases; it's typically part of a broader treatment plan that may also include surgery, radiation, and/or targeted therapy.  The goal of combining chemotherapy with radiation is often to enhance the effectiveness of both treatments and improve patient outcomes.\n"
